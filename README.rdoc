= Dub (Doxygen based Ubiquitous Binder)

This is a tool to ease the creation of scripting language bindings for a C++ library.
It is currently developed to crete the OpenCV bindings for Lua in Rubyk (http://rubyk.org).

The generator uses the xml output from Doxygen to avoid parsing C++ code by itself.

= Lua Generator

Since this generator uses C++ code and memory allocation, you *MUST* compile Lua as C++ code
to avoid memory leaks (error handling should use exceptions instead of longjmp).
